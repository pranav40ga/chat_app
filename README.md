# chat_app
Real-time Chat Server
This is the backend for a real-time chat application, built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It manages user connections and message broadcasting, and it also includes an API endpoint for a Gemini-powered bot.

Setup
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

Running the Server
To start the server, use this command:

npm start

The server will then start and listen for connections on http://localhost:3000. You must have this running before you can connect with the client.
